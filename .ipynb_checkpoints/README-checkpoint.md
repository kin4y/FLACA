# üöÄ How to Run This Uvicorn App (for Total Beginners)

This guide explains *exactly* how to set up and run this Python web app using **Uvicorn** ‚Äî even if you‚Äôve never programmed before.  
Follow every step carefully, and you‚Äôll have the app running locally in your browser!

---

## üß† What This App Is
This project runs a **FastAPI / Uvicorn** web server.  
Once it‚Äôs running, you can open your browser and visit:

üëâ **http://localhost:8000**

That‚Äôs where your app will appear.

You will run it using the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

---

## üì¶ Step 0 ‚Äî Get the Code from GitHub

You‚Äôll first need to download or clone the project from GitHub.  
The link will be provided later (for example):

```
https://github.com/USERNAME/FLACA
```

### ü™£ Steps:

1. Create a folder called **FLACA** anywhere on your computer (for example, on your Desktop).  
2. Open your browser and go to the GitHub repository link.  
3. Click the green **‚ÄúCode‚Äù** button ‚Üí **‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù**.  
4. Unzip the downloaded file.  
5. Move all the extracted files into your **FLACA** folder.  

Your folder structure should look something like this:

```
FLACA/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other project files...)
```

## ü™Ñ Quick Overview of What We‚Äôll Do

1. Install **Python 3**
2. Create a **folder named FLACA**
3. Download the **GitHub project** into it
4. Create a **virtual environment**
5. Install all required **packages**
6. Run the app with **Uvicorn**
7. Open it in your **web browser**

## üß© Step-by-Step Instructions
## üß≠ Understanding the Terminal (Command Line)
Before you can install or run the app, you‚Äôll need to use something called the **terminal** (also known as the **command line** or **console**).  
Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a simple window where you type commands instead of clicking buttons.

### üñ•Ô∏è What Is the Terminal?

Think of the terminal as a text-based control center for your computer.  
Instead of using your mouse, you type instructions directly ‚Äî for example, to install Python packages, start your app, or navigate folders.

When you see instructions like this in the README:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
it means you‚Äôll type or paste that line into your terminal and press Enter.

### üí° How to Open the Terminal
#### ü™ü Windows
You have a few easy options:

Press Windows key + R, type cmd, and press Enter ‚Üí opens Command Prompt

Or click Start ‚Üí type ‚Äúcmd‚Äù ‚Üí press Enter

Or use PowerShell (works the same): click Start ‚Üí type ‚ÄúPowerShell‚Äù ‚Üí press Enter

üëâ Once open, you‚Äôll see something like:
```bash
C:\Users\YourName>
```
That‚Äôs your terminal waiting for a command.

#### üçé macOS
Open Finder

Go to Applications ‚Üí Utilities

Double-click Terminal

Alternatively, press ‚åò + Space to open Spotlight, type ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù, and hit Enter.

You‚Äôll see something like:
```bash
MacBook-Air:~ yourname$
```
#### üêß Linux
Most Linux systems already have Terminal installed.

Press Ctrl + Alt + T

Or open it from your application menu

You‚Äôll see something like:

```bash
user@computer:~$
```
### üß± What You‚Äôll Use the Terminal For
Throughout this guide, you‚Äôll use the terminal to:

Navigate to your project folder  
```bash 
cd FLACA
```
Create a virtual environment 
```bash 
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment 
```bash 
source .venv/bin/activate or .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the necessary packages 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app 
```bash 
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

That‚Äôs it! Every command in this guide should be typed or pasted into the terminal and executed by pressing Enter.

If you make a typo, just press the Up Arrow key to recall the last command, fix it, and hit Enter again.
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python
You need **Python 3.9 or newer**.

- **Windows:**  
  Download and install from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
  ‚úÖ **IMPORTANT:** Check the box ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù during installation!

- **Mac:**  
  Use [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or run:
  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```

- **Linux (Ubuntu example):**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
  ```

Check that Python is installed using the terminal with the commands below:
```bash
python --version
```
or (on some systems)
```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see something like:
```
Python 3.10.12
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the FLACA Folder

Once you‚Äôve downloaded the GitHub code and placed it in your **FLACA** folder, open a terminal:

- **Windows:** Open the folder in File Explorer, type `cmd` in the path bar, press Enter.  
- **Mac/Linux:** Open Terminal and run:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/FLACA
  ```

Example (Mac):
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/FLACA
```

Example (Windows):
```cmd
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\FLACA
```
/path/to/FLACA means that to have to actually enter the path and not type 'path/to/FLACA'. If you are unsure what the path is exactly go the folder FLACA rightclick on it and copy path.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment

This keeps the app‚Äôs dependencies separate from your system. Use the same terminal as you just opened above.

#### üíª On macOS / Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### üíª On Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### üíª On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt, the environment is active.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages

Now that your environment is active, install all the necessary packages.

run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App üéâ

With everything set up, start the app by running:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

If that doesn‚Äôt work, try:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

You should see a message like:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Open the App in Your Browser

Go to:

üëâ [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Stop the Server

When you‚Äôre done, stop the app by pressing in the terminal:

```
CTRL + C
```

That stops the running server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Problems and Fixes

| Problem | What to Do |
|----------|-------------|
| `'python' is not recognized` | Try using `python3` instead of `python`. |
| `'pip' command not found` | Use `python -m pip install ...` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'` | Run `pip install "uvicorn[standard]"` again inside `.venv`. |
| `AttributeError: module 'app' has no attribute 'app'` | Make sure `app.py` exists and defines a variable called `app`. |
| `Address already in use` | Use a different port: `uvicorn app:app --reload --port 5001` |
| Browser won‚Äôt connect | Ensure Uvicorn is running and not blocked by a firewall. |

## ‚úÖ Final Quick Summary

To recap, here‚Äôs everything in one place:

```bash
# 1. Create a folder
mkdir FLACA
cd FLACA

# 2. Download or unzip your GitHub code here

# 3. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
source .venv/bin/activate    # (Mac/Linux)

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the server
uvicorn app:app --reload

# 6. Open in browser
http://localhost:8000
```

That‚Äôs it! üéâ  
You‚Äôve successfully installed and run your **FLACA Uvicorn App** locally.
